# Basic IoT Weather Station Data Logger
## Requirements
1. **Sensor Data Simulation:** Simulate real-time data collection from sensors measuring:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Atmospheric pressure
The data should be generated for different global locations to simulate diversity in environmental conditions.

2. **Data Collection and Logging:** Implement periodic data collection from all sensors and store the collected data in a log file. Each log entry must include:
- Timestamp
- Sensor type
- Sensor reading
- Geographic location

3. **Automated Responses:** Create automated responses that trigger actions when sensor data exceeds predefined thresholds (e.g., a warning when the temperature exceeds a specific value).

4. **Data Retrieval:** Implement a mechanism to retrieve historical data based on criteria such as:
- Date range
- Sensor type
- Location

5. **Data Processing:** Include basic data processing features, such as:

- Calculating daily averages
- Generating alerts when anomalies are detected
- Comparing data across different locations
